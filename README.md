# AutomatedReconKit (ARK) - `autork`

**AutomatedReconKit (ARK)** is a Python library designed to streamline and automate common network reconnaissance tasks. It provides a powerful yet easy-to-use Pythonic interface to the Nmap network scanner, parsing its XML output into structured Python objects for straightforward programmatic access and further analysis.

ARK allows for flexible control over various Nmap scan parameters, including host discovery, TCP and UDP port scanning, service and version detection, OS detection, Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) execution with custom scripts and arguments, timing templates, selectable TCP scan types, IPv6 scanning, and detailed reason reporting for port states. Results can be easily exported to JSON/CSV or saved and loaded for session persistence.

## Why use autork?

autork takes the power and versatility of Nmap and makes it programmatically accessible and manageable within Python, which is precisely what's needed to automate and streamline network reconnaissance for pentesters.
* Define complex scan profiles and run them consistently and repeatably.
* Automate and customize scanning of large target lists.
* Integrate Nmap results into larger custom toolchains through output and export features.
* Process and analyze Nmap data in sophisticated and programmatic ways using Python.

## Core Features

* **Versatile Target Specification:**
    * Scan single IPs, hostnames, or CIDR ranges.
    * Read targets from a file (`-iL` equivalent).
    * Exclude specified targets or targets from a file (`--exclude`, `--excludefile` for discovery).
* **Comprehensive Host Discovery:**
    * Ping scans (`-sn`) with configurable Nmap timing templates.
    * (Future: Support for specific Nmap ping types like TCP SYN/ACK, UDP, ICMP pings).
* **Detailed Port Scanning:**
    * **TCP Scans:** Service & version detection (`-sV`), selectable scan techniques (`-sS` SYN, `-sT` Connect, `-sF` FIN, `-sX` Xmas, `-sN` Null, `-sA` ACK).
    * **UDP Scans:** Service & version detection (`-sU -sV`).
    * Flexible port specification (top N ports, full range, specific ports via Nmap syntax).
* **Operating System (OS) Detection:** Uses Nmap's `-O` flag.
* **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) Integration:**
    * Run custom scripts, categories (e.g., "default", "vuln"), or all scripts.
    * Pass arguments to NSE scripts (`--script-args`).
* **Rich Data Extraction:**
    * Host status, IP addresses (IPv4 & IPv6), hostnames.
    * Port details: number, protocol, state, service name, product, version, extrainfo.
    * Detailed reasons for port states (if Nmap's `--reason` flag is enabled).
    * OS match details (name, accuracy).
    * MAC address and vendor (for local network scans).
    * Host uptime, last boot time, and network distance (when available).
    * Raw output from host-level and port-level NSE scripts.
* **Scan Control:**
    * Nmap timing templates (`-T0` to `-T5`).
    * IPv6 scanning support (`-6`).
* **Structured Output:** Results are parsed into clean Python dataclasses (`Host`, `Port`, `Service`, `OSMatch`).
* **Data Handling:**
    * Export scan results to JSON and CSV formats.
    * Save and load complete scan sessions (list of `Host` objects) to/from JSON files.
* **Usability:**
    * Informative logging using Python's `logging` module.
    * Flexible Nmap executable path configuration (explicit, environment variable `ARK_NMAP_PATH`, or system PATH).

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* **Nmap:** Must be installed on your system and accessible via the system's PATH, or the path to the Nmap executable must be configured (see Configuration section). Download Nmap from [https://nmap.org](https://nmap.org).

## Installation

Currently, `autork` is best installed directly from the source for development or local use.

1.  **Install Nmap:**
    If you haven't already, download and install Nmap from [https://nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html). Ensure the `nmap` command is executable and in your system's PATH.

2.  **Use pip to install autork:**
    ```bash
    pip install autork
    ```

3.  **(Recommended) Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows PowerShell:
    # .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # On Windows CMD:
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # On Linux/macOS:
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install `autork` in editable mode (for development):**
    This command also installs dependencies needed for testing.
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[test] 
    ```
    If you only want to install `autork` without test dependencies (once it's more formally packaged for use as a library and has runtime dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`):
    ```bash
    # pip install . 
    ```
    (Currently, `autork` has no external runtime dependencies beyond Python's standard library).

## Basic Usage Example

Here's an example demonstrating several features of `autork`:

```python
import logging
import os
from typing import List, Optional

# Assuming 'autork' is installed (e.g., pip install -e .)
from autork.engine import ARKEngine
from autork.datamodels import Host # For type hinting if you inspect results deeply

# --- Basic Logging Configuration ---
# Configure logging to see messages from ARK and this script
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,  # Change to logging.DEBUG for more verbosity from ARK
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'

## Key Features Showcased in this test_ark.py:

* Configuration: Demonstrates how ARKEngine is initialized (with a note on nmap_path).
* Logging: Includes basic logging setup to see output from both autork and the script itself.
* Target Management: Shows how to use target_scope OR input_target_file, and placeholders for exclude_targets/exclude_file. Includes helper functions to create dummy files for these.
* IPv6 Scanning: Has a use_ipv6 flag and changes the target to an IPv6 address if enabled.
* Comprehensive Scan Options: Sets parameters for TCP scan type, timing, OS detection, NSE scripts and arguments, and UDP scanning.
* Privilege Warnings: Logs warnings based on selected options.
* Error Handling: Basic try-except around ARKEngine instantiation and perform_basic_recon.
* Detailed Results Processing: Loops through hosts and ports, printing many of the details autork can extract, including script outputs and port reasons.
* Export & Save/Load: Demonstrates calling export_to_json, export_to_csv, save_scan_results, and load_scan_results, with a basic verification of the loaded data.
* Cleanup: Removes dummy files created by the script.

This script should give a very good demonstration of autork's full capabilities. Remember to adjust the scan parameters at the top of run_scan_example() to test different scenarios quickly.
